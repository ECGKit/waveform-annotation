Thank you for agreeing to help evaluate our new tool for expert-annotation of
Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) alarms. We
would like you to classify VT/VF alarms that have been generated by patient
monitors as either “True” or “False”. You will find log-in here:

{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'register' %}

You can also find usage instructions here:

{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'viewer_tutorial' %}

If clicking any of the links above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
in a new browser window instead.

We would also love to set up a follow-up meeting to hear your feedback and
suggestions for improvement. In particular, we are interested in understanding
whether the tool provides all of the features that you need to perform the
annotation task. If not, what are the specific features that are missing or
could be improved upon? Please comment on usability, resolution, navigation,
etc.

Thank you again for your collaboration and happy annotating!

Sincerely,
The MIT VT/VF Annotation Team
